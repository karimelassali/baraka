        applicable]. You can contact us at [privacy email] or [phone], or by
        post to the address above. If appointed, our Data Protection Officer
        (DPO) can be reached at [DPO email]. If we are not established in the
        EU, our EU Representative is [Name, Address, Email].​ What this policy
        covers This policy explains how we collect, use, share, store, secure,
        and delete your personal data when you visit, register, or use [Service
        Name] (the “Service”), and describes your rights under the GDPR.​ The
        data we collect Identification and contact data: first name, last name,
        email, phone.​ Account data: password (stored hashed), language
        preferences, account settings.​ Demographic and profile data: date of
        birth, residence, country of origin.​ Technical data: IP address, device
        identifiers, browser type, pages viewed, and timestamps.​ Cookies/SDK
        data: necessary and, with consent, analytics/marketing cookies. See
        “Cookies and similar technologies.”​ Optional data you provide to
        support, surveys, or feature requests.​ Do not provide special
        categories of data (e.g., health, biometric, political opinions) unless
        specifically requested and lawfully justified; otherwise we will not
        knowingly process them.​ Why we process your data (purposes) and our
        legal bases We process personal data only where a valid legal basis
        applies: Account creation and administration: to register you,
        authenticate you, and provide the Service (contract).​ Service operation
        and security: to operate, maintain, troubleshoot, prevent fraud/abuse
        (legitimate interests; where needed, legal obligation).​ Communications:
        service emails about changes, security, or account notices
        (contract/legal obligation); optional marketing with your consent and an
        opt‑out.​ Analytics and improvement: to understand usage, improve
        performance and features (legitimate interests; analytics cookies only
        with consent).​ Compliance: to meet legal obligations (tax, accounting,
        regulatory requests), enforce terms, protect rights.​ Where we rely on
        legitimate interests, we balance our interests against your rights and
        freedoms and can provide details upon request. You may object to
        processing based on legitimate interests.​ If you must provide data
        Where data are necessary to create an account or provide the Service,
        failure to provide them may prevent registration or access. Mandatory
        fields are marked at registration.​ Who receives your data (sharing and
        disclosures) We share data only as needed: Service providers
        (processors): hosting, analytics, customer support, communications,
        payments. They act on our instructions and under data protection
        agreements.​ Legal and compliance: authorities or third parties when
        required by law or to protect rights and safety.​ Business transfers: in
        a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, subject to safeguards and notice.​
        We do not sell your personal data.​ International data transfers If we
        transfer your data outside the EEA/UK, we use approved safeguards such
        as European Commission adequacy decisions or Standard Contractual
        Clauses, and, where needed, supplementary measures. You can request a
        copy of relevant safeguards.​ How long we keep your data (retention) We
        keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes in this
        policy: Account data: for the life of your account and a reasonable
        period thereafter for record‑keeping, security, and legal obligations.​
        Transactional/technical logs: for shorter periods aligned with security
        and audit needs.​ We apply criteria such as legal limitation periods,
        regulatory requirements, and operational needs. When no longer needed,
        we delete or irreversibly anonymize data.​ Your privacy rights Under the
        GDPR, you have: Right of access: get a copy of your personal data.​
        Right to rectification: correct inaccurate or incomplete data.​ Right to
        erasure: request deletion in certain cases (e.g., consent withdrawal, no
        longer needed).​ Right to restriction: limit processing in specific
        circumstances.​ Right to portability: receive your data in a
        machine‑readable format and have it transmitted to another controller
        where technically feasible.​ Right to object: object to processing based
        on legitimate interests or direct marketing.​ Rights related to
        automated decision‑making: request human review and contest decisions
        where applicable.​ To exercise these rights, contact us at [privacy
        email]. We may need to verify your identity. You also have the right to
        lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.​ Consent and
        withdrawal Where processing relies on your consent (e.g., marketing or
        non‑essential cookies), you may withdraw consent at any time via account
        settings, cookie banner, unsubscribe links, or by contacting us, without
        affecting processing before withdrawal.​ Cookies and similar
        technologies We use: Strictly necessary cookies: required for login,
        security, and core functions (no consent needed).​ With your consent:
        analytics and, if used, marketing cookies. You can manage preferences in
        the cookie banner or browser settings at any time. See our Cookie Policy
        for details on categories, purposes, lifetimes, and providers.​
        Children’s data Our Service is not directed to children under the age
        required by local law. If we learn we processed a child’s data without
        appropriate consent, we will delete it. Additional parental consent
        obligations apply for children’s consent in some jurisdictions.​
        Security We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures
        to protect personal data, including encryption in transit, access
        controls, secure development practices, and vendor due diligence. No
        system is 100% secure; we maintain and improve safeguards over time.​
        Automated decision‑making We do not use automated decision‑making that
        produces legal or similarly significant effects without appropriate
        safeguards. If we introduce such processing, we will provide required
        notices and meaningful information about the logic, significance, and
        consequences, and enable your rights.​ Third‑party sites The Service may
        link to third‑party websites or services. Their privacy practices are
        governed by their own policies; review them before providing data.​
        Changes to this policy We may update this policy to reflect changes in
        law, technology, or our practices. We will update the “Last updated”
        date and, where required, provide prominent notice or request renewed
        consent.​ Contact and complaints Questions or requests: [privacy email],
        [postal address], [phone]. You have the right to lodge a complaint with
        a data protection authority, such as the authority in your habitual
        residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement.​ Last
        updated: [Date]
