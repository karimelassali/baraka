        Address], company/tax number [Number if applicable]. Contact: [support
        email] and [phone number]. By accessing or registering, you agree to
        these Terms.​ Definitions “Service” means the [website/app name],
        related features, and content we provide. “User,” “you,” or “your” means
        any person who visits, registers, or uses the Service. “Content” means
        text, images, data, or materials displayed on or transmitted via the
        Service.​ Eligibility and Account Registration You must be the legal age
        of majority in your country of residence, or have valid parental consent
        if permitted by law. You agree to provide accurate, complete information
        and to keep your login credentials confidential. You are responsible for
        all activity under your account and must promptly notify us of any
        suspected unauthorized use or security breach. We may suspend or
        terminate accounts that violate these Terms.​ Service Description and
        Changes We provide fast registration, secure storage, and a personal
        account area with features that may change over time. We may add,
        modify, or discontinue features or the Service (in whole or part). We
        aim to avoid disruptions but cannot guarantee continuous availability.​
        Acceptable Use You agree not to: Break any applicable laws or
        regulations. Attempt unauthorized access, probe or bypass security, or
        interfere with the Service. Post or transmit unlawful, abusive,
        infringing, deceptive, or harmful content. Harvest or collect others’
        data without their explicit consent. We may remove violating content and
        suspend or terminate access for breaches.​ User Content and License You
        retain ownership of your content. You grant us a non‑exclusive,
        worldwide license to host, store, reproduce, and display your content
        solely to operate and improve the Service. We do not claim ownership of
        your content and will process removal requests in line with applicable
        law.​ Intellectual Property The Service, including software, design,
        brand, and all associated intellectual property, is owned by or licensed
        to us. You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, or create
        derivative works unless permitted by law or with our prior written
        consent.​ Third‑Party Links and Services The Service may link to or
        integrate with third‑party sites or services. We are not responsible for
        any third‑party content, policies, or practices; use of such resources
        is at your own risk.​ Pricing and Payments (if applicable) If any paid
        features apply, pricing and payment terms will be shown clearly before
        purchase. Accepted payment methods, billing cycles, taxes, and any
        additional fees will be disclosed. Subscription terms (renewal,
        cancellation, proration) will be stated at checkout and in your
        account.​ Shipping, Returns, and Refunds (if selling goods) Shipping:
        regions served, delivery estimates, and costs. Returns: return window,
        condition requirements, and process. Refunds: eligibility, timeline, and
        method. Mandatory consumer rights apply and prevail over conflicting
        terms.​ Consumer Rights and Withdrawal For distance contracts with EU
        consumers, you may have a 14‑day right of withdrawal under national laws
        implementing EU rules, subject to legal exceptions (e.g., after starting
        delivery of digital content/services with your express consent and
        acknowledgment of losing the withdrawal right). These Terms do not
        affect your mandatory consumer rights. Any unfair term that creates a
        significant imbalance to the detriment of the consumer is not binding.
        We outline how to cancel, what happens on cancellation, and any fair,
        pre‑disclosed costs.​ Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability The
        Service is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of
        any kind (express or implied) to the maximum extent permitted by law,
        including non‑infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a
        particular purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not
        liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
        damages, or loss of profits, data, or goodwill arising from or related
        to your use of the Service. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits
        liability where it would be unlawful to do so (for example, liability
        for death or personal injury caused by negligence).​ Indemnification You
        agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, losses,
        liabilities, damages, and costs (including reasonable legal fees)
        arising from your breach of these Terms or misuse of the Service, to the
        extent permitted by law.​ Site Management and Support We may monitor
        compliance, remove or disable access to content, manage the Service to
        protect its integrity, and perform maintenance. Support is available via
        the channels stated on the Service or in these Terms.​ Suspension and
        Termination We may suspend or terminate your account immediately if you
        breach these Terms, misuse the Service, or where legally or technically
        required. You may close your account at any time through your settings
        or by contacting us. Sections intended to survive termination (e.g., IP,
        disclaimers, liability limits) will continue to apply.​ Privacy and Data
        Protection Your personal data is processed in accordance with our
        Privacy Policy, which explains legal bases, purposes, retention periods,
        transfers, and your rights under the GDPR. By using the Service, you
        agree to comply with the Privacy Policy; where consent is the legal
        basis, you can withdraw it at any time without affecting prior
        processing.​ Governing Law and Jurisdiction These Terms are governed by
        the laws of [Member State], without prejudice to mandatory consumer
        protection provisions of your country of residence if you are an EU
        consumer. Disputes will be subject to the non‑exclusive jurisdiction of
        the courts of [City, Country].​ Changes to These Terms We may update
        these Terms to reflect legal, technical, or business changes. We will
        indicate the “Last updated” date and, where required, provide reasonable
        notice or request renewed consent. Continued use after changes
        constitutes acceptance.​ Contact Questions about these Terms can be sent
        to: [Company Name], [Address], [support email], [phone].​ Last updated:
        [Date] Notes for you to customize before publishing: Add clear 14‑day
        withdrawal instructions and a model withdrawal form if you sell to EU
        consumers at a distance, and state exceptions for digital
        services/content where you obtain express consent to immediate
        performance.​ Make sure “Governing law” and “Jurisdiction” reflect your
        actual establishment, but include the EU consumer protection safeguard
        language.​ Keep your Privacy Policy link adjacent to the checkboxes and
        ensure checkboxes are not pre‑ticked and are recorded with timestamp for
        consent evidence.​ If processing personal data on behalf of business
        clients, you may also need a Data Processing Agreement; keep Standard
        Contractual Clauses in mind for extra‑EEA transfers when applicable.​
